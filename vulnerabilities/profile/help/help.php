				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>This vulnerability allows users to search for user profiles in the system. The search functionality demonstrates different security levels for handling user input in database queries.</p>

				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<p>Your goal is to test the profile search functionality for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Try to determine if user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in database queries.</p>

				<br /><hr /><br />

				<h3>Low Level</h3>
				<p>The low level uses a complex dataflow with multiple files and classes, but includes a whitelist validation that restricts input to predefined values.</p>

				<h3>Medium Level</h3>
				<p>Same as low level for this demonstration.</p>

				<h3>High Level</h3>
				<p>Same as low level for this demonstration.</p>

				<h3>Impossible Level</h3>
				<p>The impossible level uses proper parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks completely.</p>
