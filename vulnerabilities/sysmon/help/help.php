				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>This vulnerability demonstrates system monitoring capabilities with potential command injection vulnerabilities depending on the security level.</p>

				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<p>Your goal is to test the system monitoring functionality for potential command injection vulnerabilities. Try to determine if user input is properly validated before being passed to system commands.</p>

				<br /><hr /><br />

				<h3>Low Level</h3>
				<p>The low level uses a complex dataflow across multiple classes with comprehensive security filtering that removes dangerous characters and commands.</p>

				<h3>Medium Level</h3>
				<p>Same as low level for this demonstration.</p>

				<h3>High Level</h3>
				<p>Same as low level for this demonstration.</p>

				<h3>Impossible Level</h3>
				<p>The impossible level uses proper input validation and escapeshellarg() to prevent command injection attacks completely.</p>
